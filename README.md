 Unit 2 Project: List Pagination and Filtering

Goal of earning a 'meets expectations' grade on this project:
-create code that will hide and show HTML on a page by implementing a set of buttons being added to the page dynamically (pagination links.)
-practice unobtrusive JavaScript and progressive enhacement. 
-show first 10 students at page load, each pagination link shows correct number of students
  -clicking '1' will show students 1-10, '2' shows 11-20, etc
  -code should run the same using any number of students
-Code comments included to explain how each function works and its purpose
  
I am going for an "exceeds expectations" grade, which requires additional goals:
-Use unobtrusive JavaScript to append HTML for a search bar
-Pagination links show based on how many search results returned
  -if 10 or less results returned, 0 or 1 pagination links displayed
  -if 22 search results returned, 3 paginination links will display
-Includes message informing user of 'no results' to be displayed on page when "0" results are found in a search entry
